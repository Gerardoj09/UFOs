# UFOs Challenge 11 GJP

## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana to publish her data in a dynamic webpage using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Results
### The user will observe a form at the bottom left of the webpage where him/her will introduce input data, and after pressing "Enter", the code will loop through the provided dataset to automatically filter and updated the table matching the search criteria.

## Summary
### A potential drawback of this new design would be that the user might be confused in how to go back to visualize the original table data without filters and be sure that no filters are applied.
### My first recommendation would be to include again a button to initialize the filtering action.
### The second recommendation would be to include a "clear" button to clear the input data by the user from all fields.
