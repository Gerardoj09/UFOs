# UFOs - Web scrapping

## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana to publish her data in a dynamic webpage using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Results
### The user will observe a form at the bottom left of the webpage where him/her will introduce input data, and after pressing "Enter", the code will loop through the provided dataset to automatically filter and updated the table matching the search criteria.

## Summary
### A potential drawback of this new design would be that the user might introduce mixed data that do not match with any other value in the dataset, so the table will not display any matching value; this might confuse the final user.
### My first recommendation would be to include again a button to initialize the filtering action.
### The second recommendation would be to include a "clear" button to clear the input data by the user from all fields.
